# Stripe Payment Integration

This project now uses Stripe Elements for secure payment processing in test mode.

## Features

- **Stripe Payment Element**: Official Stripe UI components for secure card input
- **Test Mode**: Uses Stripe test keys for safe development
- **Payment Method Tokenization**: Creates secure payment method IDs without charging
- **Mock Payment Flow**: Simulates real payment processing for frontend development

## Setup

1. **Environment Variables**: Add your Stripe publishable key to `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
   ```

2. **Test Cards**: Use these test card numbers:
   - **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - **Declined**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
   - **Insufficient Funds**: `4000 0000 0000 9995`
   - **Expired**: `4000 0000 0000 0069`

## How It Works

1. User clicks "Confirm and Pay" button
2. Stripe Payment Dialog opens with official Stripe Elements
3. User enters card details in secure Stripe-hosted iframes
4. `stripe.createPaymentMethod()` generates a Payment Method ID
5. Success/Error dialog shows result with Payment Method ID
6. Payment Method ID is logged for backend integration

## Backend Integration

The frontend generates a Payment Method ID (e.g., `pm_1234567890abcdef`) that your backend can use to:

1. Confirm the payment with `stripe.paymentIntents.confirm()`
2. Create a subscription with `stripe.subscriptions.create()`
3. Store the payment method for future use

## Security

- Card details never touch your servers
- Stripe Elements handle PCI compliance
- Payment Method IDs are secure tokens
- Test mode prevents real charges
